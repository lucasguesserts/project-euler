# Problem 2

## Problem description

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

**Answer:** 4613732

## Strategy - Recursion

1. Define Fibonacci using recursion.
2. Create an infite list with fibonacci numbers.
3. Take the values of the list that do not exceed four million.
   and are even.
4. Sum them.

**Required time:** approx 3.2 s

## Strategy - Closed form

1. Define Fibonacci using
   [the closed-form equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number#Closed-form_expression)
   phi = (1 + sqrt 5) / 2
   fibonacci n = round (phi^n / sqrt 5)
2. Create an infite list with fibonacci numbers.
3. Take the values of the list
   that do not exceed four million
   and are even.
4. Sum them.

**Required time:** approx 0.006 s
